Rainbow Dash had left the building a few minutes ago, but Magi still lingered there, lazily sipping her energy drink.

Lost in her thoughts, she reflected on how things could have turned out so well. She had considered using some of her mind control magical artifacts on Dash, but in the end, they turned out to be unnecessary.

The rainbow-maned Pegasus had quickly signed without consulting details, not even seeming to care about what Magi had told her about the binding document and its appendices. After a brief farewell and an agreement to meet again in a few days, Rainbow Dash left smiling, cradling the Daring Do manuscripts in her arms like a mother with her lost child.

"What a mare..." Magi chuckled quietly. Although she didn't know the princess or her other friends personally, if one judged the ponies around you to know who you were, she had already started to form an idea.

"It will be interesting... I'll have to be prepared," said Magi, carefully storing the empty can of her energy drink in one of the drawers of her desk. This wasn't an ordinary can. Although it looked like any other can, it had been adapted to be more durable and preserve the contents better. Additionally, it was refillable, a detail that Magi took advantage of to pretend to drink from that commercial product when she actually enjoyed other beverages.

She swiveled in her chair and observed the bustling cityscape from her office without much interest.

"I have my own place, I have a great sponsor, and now I have a good product. Fortune smiles upon me as always. Is it time to celebrate?" mused Magi with a smile as she considered her recent achievements aloud.

The Pegasus watched the sunset for a few minutes, yawned, and stretched her limbs. She swiveled in her chair, checked her desk, and retrieved a pair of runic-carved stones from one of the drawers. She then went to the adjoining room and carefully opened the hidden safe behind a painting. She placed the stones inside and retrieved the document Rainbow Dash had signed. She took it and headed to the reception area.

Despite the hour, the dedicated receptionist pony was still there, immersed in her work.

"You're still working at this hour, I don't pay you to be so dedicated," said Magi as she entered the reception, a mischievous glint in her eyes.

The receptionist didn't seem to mind and continued with her work.

Suddenly, Magi forcefully pushed the receptionist's chair back and hugged her, pulling her away from her desk. For a few seconds, they struggled until the receptionist finally let her limbs go limp. They remained in silence for a few minutes without making any further movements.

"Magi... I need to finish the transfer documents for Miss Dash's case," pleaded the secretary, her gaze fixed on the floor and her voice timid.

"Leave that, I'll finish your paperwork later tonight. Let's take a break now," said the smiling Pegasus as she continued to hug the receptionist.

"Okay..." said the secretary as she responded to her words with her own embrace.

Magically, the lights in the room dimmed, leaving only the twilight filtering through the windows.

"What do you plan to do to the princess's friend?" asked the secretary.

"I plan to drive her crazy," replied Magi with an even bigger smile.

"Hehehe..." The secretary laughed for a moment but then backed away slightly from her partner's embrace. Visible were the bright scarlet eyes peeking out from under her brown mane. Their gazes met. "Isn't all this dangerous? Will it work?"

"Trust me, darling, everything will be fine. We'll be fine, I have all the cards in our favor. And above all, I have you," said Magi with darkness obscuring her face. A moment later, timid kisses landed on her cheek, and these were met with another embrace.

Slowly, the light dwindled in the room, oblivious to the whispers of the restless night that flourished on the top floor of the Average Tower. The weary construction workers left the unfinished building and vanished into the streets of the bustling city.
